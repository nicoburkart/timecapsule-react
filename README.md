# TimeCapsule.io

Deployed at: https://timecapsule-io.web.app/

TimeCapsule.io is a smart contract on the ethereum blockchain. The idea is to put eth in a digital capsule. The capsule can be opened by a receipient after a given time (both receipient and sender are defined by the sender of the capsule). This can serve as a will/gift from the sender to a certain date.

The contract can be found in the src/truffle/contracts directory and is currently not deployed on the ethereum mainnet.

This project was a learning project that I did in my freetime to learn more about smart contracts and blockchain technology.

## Run local

To be able to interact with the smart contract do the following:

1. Setup a local development environment (ganache + local Metamask on chrome running on port 7545 + install truffle)

2. run npm install

3. run truffle compile

4. run truffle migrate

5. run npm start
